🚀 Smart Object Detection with AI
📌 Project Description
Smart Object Detection with AI is a real-time application that uses computer vision and deep learning models (YOLOv8/YOLOv5 or OpenCV-based) to detect and recognize objects from a live webcam feed or pre-recorded videos.
It not only displays the object name with accuracy percentage on the screen but can also speak out the detected objects using text-to-speech (TTS) for better accessibility and user experience.
This project can be extended for use in:
Smart surveillance systems
Autonomous driving assistance
Retail monitoring
AI-powered accessibility tools
⚙️ Requirements
Before running the project, install the following dependencies:
Python 3.8+
OpenCV – For video capturing and image processing
NumPy – For mathematical operations
Ultralytics YOLOv8 – For AI object detection
gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) – For audio output
PyTorch – Required for YOLO model
Other utilities – OS, time, threading
