üöÄ Smart Object Detection with AI
üìå Project Description
Smart Object Detection with AI is a real-time application that uses computer vision and deep learning models (YOLOv8/YOLOv5 or OpenCV-based) to detect and recognize objects from a live webcam feed or pre-recorded videos.
It not only displays the object name with accuracy percentage on the screen but can also speak out the detected objects using text-to-speech (TTS) for better accessibility and user experience.
This project can be extended for use in:
Smart surveillance systems
Autonomous driving assistance
Retail monitoring
AI-powered accessibility tools
‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
Before running the project, install the following dependencies:
Python 3.8+
OpenCV ‚Äì For video capturing and image processing
NumPy ‚Äì For mathematical operations
Ultralytics YOLOv8 ‚Äì For AI object detection
gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) ‚Äì For audio output
PyTorch ‚Äì Required for YOLO model
Other utilities ‚Äì OS, time, threading

NOTE .. FOR FASTER PROCESSING AND BETTER RESULT YOU CAN DOWNLOAD ANOTHER YOLOV8 MODEL WITH YOU CHOICE
